Tomcat Servers :
Installation on Windows :
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Download the "32-bit/64-bit Window Service installer"
* Go to "Run bx" -> Services.msc -> click on "Start" for "Apace Tomcat 8.5"
  [Port needs to be changed on jenkins. Normally, Tomcat works on port 8080]
* while installing, keep everything as default and give following input when prompted on "Configuration" screen. Give :
  "User name" = admin and "Password" = admin
  Server shutdown port = 8085
  http/1.1 Connector port = 8080
  AJP/1.3 Connector port = 8009
  Window Service name = Tomcat 8
* Check on "Services.msc", if it is up and running.
* Go to chrome : http://localhost:8089 (will open "Apache Tomcat Service" page)
* Click on "Manager App" and give Username and password
* In "WAR file to Deploy", click on "Chose file" and browse to "Target folder", where "Petclinic.war" exists, select and deploy it.
* Under "Application" section, we can see "/petclinic". If started, "Start" button will get blocked.
* Click on "/petclinic" under "Application" tab under "path" column.



Installation on Linux :
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
* yum erase httpd -y
* Check if Java is installed (give "java -version")
* Create a group called tomcat :
  sudo groupadd tomcat
* Create users and add them to the group tomcat :
  sudo useradd -M -s /bin/nologin -g tomcat -d /opt/tomcat tomcat
  sudo useradd -s /bin/nologin -g tomcat -d /opt/tomcat tomcat		#### may not be required
  (So, group "tomcat" will have its home directory in /opt/tomcat)
* sudo mkdir /opt/tomcat
* Go to "cd Downloads/" and give "wget http://redrockdigimark.com/apachemirror/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.31/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.31.tar.gz"
* Create a directory and unzip the package as below
  sudo tar xvf apache-tomcat-8*tar.gz -C /opt/tomcat
* Providing the necessary permissions for the folders
  cd /opt/tomcat	-> ls -l =0 (apache-tomcat-8.5.31)				#### or cd /opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-8/
  chgrp -R tomcat /opt/tomcat										#### or chgrp -R tomcat /opt/tomcat/*
  cd apache-tomcat-8.5.31/
  chmod -R g+r conf													#### or chmod -R g+r conf/*
  chgrp -R tomcat /opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-8.5.31/
  chmod g+x conf
  chown -R tomcat webapps/ work/ temp/ logs/
* Create a config file, as we will not be able to use systemctl. 
  "Systemctl" is not recognizing tomcat, so we will create a configuration file in "etc/systemd"
* vi /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service
  and copy tth whole code mentioned below in it :
  # Systemd unit file for tomcat
  [Unit]
  Description=Apache Tomcat Web Application Container
  After=syslog.target network.target

  [Service]
  Type=forking

  Environment=JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre
  Environment=CATALINA_PID=/opt/tomcat/temp/tomcat.pid
  Environment=CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat
  Environment=CATALINA_BASE=/opt/tomcat
  Environment='CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms512M -Xmx1024M -server -XX:+UseParallelGC'
  Environment='JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.awt.headless=true -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom'

  ExecStart=/opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
  ExecStop=/bin/kill -15 $MAINPID

  User=tomcat
  Group=tomcat
  UMask=0007
  RestartSec=10
  Restart=always

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target 
* Restart the systemctl daemon.
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl start tomcat
  systemctl enable tomcat
* Goto browser and type the below address as given : http://server_IP_address:8080		#### will throw error
* Providing permission for manager to edit the apps in the apache web server.
  vi /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml 			#### and check for this line in the file and paste below lines in the bottom of the file and save it.
  <tomcat-users>
      <user username="admin" password="password" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>
  </tomcat-users>
* Restart the systemctl daemon.
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl start tomcat
  systemctl enable tomcat

* Sometimes, clicking on "Manager App" will not ask for username/password and shows "401 Unauthorised". This is due to upgradation of Tomcat version.
  So, do the following :
  cat hosts
    192.168.191.151. master.example.com master
  vim /opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-8.5.31/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml
    change from 		:: allow = "127\.\d ...d+\::1\0:...0:1\>"
	to 					:: allow = "192\.168\.1\.124/127\...d+\::1\0:...0:1\>"
	or to comment from 	::"<Context ... end_of_line_of allow /> and write "<Context> below line. Ex : <Context>
																									  <Manager...
	or to 				:: allow = ".*"/>
	or to 				:: allow = "^.*$"/>
* Restart the systemctl daemon.
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl start tomcat
  systemctl enable tomcat
	
* Now Webserver has been configured in Centos machine.

Step:1
Installing JAVA or check if java is already installed using "java --version"

sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel
Note that a shortcut to the JAVA_HOME directory, which we will need to configure Tomcat later, can be found at /usr/lib/jvm/jre
