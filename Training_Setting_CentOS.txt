Important prequisites points :
******************************
* Clone in VM can be done only after shutting down.
* Command line change is applied straight way, but after logging off/reboot it goes off. 
  Configs file change can be seen only after reboot, but it will be premanent.
  Ex: hotsname jenkins.server.com 
  vi /etc/hostname #### And then writing jenkins.server.com inside it.
* Check date : date
* Stop firewall : 
  systemstl status firewalld #### (Active: active (running))
  systemstl stop firewalld
  systemstl disable firewalld
  systemstl status firewalld #### (Active: inactive (dead))
* Turning off selinux for proper working of protocols in Apache servers (for Redhat based OS):
  getenforce   #### will show the status 'Enforcing'
  setenforce 0 #### will switch off the SELinux
  getenforce   #### will show the status Permissive
* cd /home/aditya/ - always work from YOUR home directory.
* ip a 	       #### checks the ip of the system under "enp0s3" session
* Set HOSTNAME and edit /etc/hosts file as below. In this system, we have set the hostname as "jenkins.example.com" and its ip is "192.168.31.164"
  HOSTNAME : slave.server.com
  HOSTS : 192.168.31.123 slave.example.com slave
	  192.168.31.164 jenkins.example.com jenkins
  "Ping" should work for "192.168.31.164" or "jenkins.example.com" or "jenkins"

  scp /etc/hosts  192.168.191.151:/etc/hosts ----> copy one file from source to target.


* kill -9 pid		----> will kill that pid
* df -h 		----> shows all directories and external devices and their Size, Used , Available and Use %
* fdisk -l 		----> 
* fdisk /dev/sda 	----> starts process to create new drive in hard disk (sda). sda1 and sda2 were already created
  p -> m -> n -> p	----> will create a new drive with name sda3 and then finallt 'w' to write the changes
* free -m
* swapon 
* cat /etc/fstab
* swapoff /dev/mapper/centos-swap
* cat /var/logs/messages | grep -i error --->  system related logs will exists here


Setting up of static-ip
***********************
-> Making the IP static
   If my ip is 192.168.191.149, gateway will be 192.168.191.1 (2nd ip address of the series)

-> vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3
   TYPE="Ethernet"
   BOOTPROTO="none" or "static"
   NAME="enp0s3"
   UUID="fecff1bc-164b-4fb4-a0f4-cf7bb9c6c12b"
   DEVICE="enp0s3"
   ONBOOT="yes"
   IPADDR=192.168.191.149
   NETMASK=255.255.255.0
   GATEWAY=192.168.191.2
   DNS1=192.168.191.2
   DNS2=8.8.8.8
  
-> systemctl restart network
