* git push origin master	->  checkout in branch1

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIT REVERT :
--------------------------------------
* create a file in local repository in folder "revert.txt".
* Add and commit this file.
* modify this file in folder.
* commit again for this file.
* git log 
* copy the first 8 hexadecimal digits (second one for reverting to previous version, first one will be for the latest modified one)
* git checkout 8-digit_hexadecimal_code revert.txt	-> (through master branch)

Example :
GIT REVERT : 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
$ git log --oneline					=> 2b2812f (HEAD -> master) added f1
$ touch f2
$ git add f2
$ git commit -am "adding f2"		=> 546b2cd (HEAD -> master) added f2)
$ touch f3
$ git add f3
$ git commit -am "adding f3"		=> 1783f63 (HEAD -> master) adding f3
$ git log --oneline
  1783f63 (HEAD -> master) adding f3
  546b2cd adding f2
  2b2812f added f1
$ git revert 546b2cd
  [master 38b4729] Revert "adding f2"
  1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-) delete mode 100644 f2
$ git log --oneline
  38b4729 (HEAD -> master) Revert "adding f2"
  1783f63 adding f3
  546b2cd adding f2
  2b2812f added f1

$ ls								=> f1  f3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          
GIT RESET : (--soft, --mixed, --hard) practice
--------------------------------------
--soft  : Tells Git to reset HEAD to another commit, so index and the working directory will not be altered in any way.
		  All of the files changed between the original HEAD and the commit will be staged.
--mixed : Just like the soft, this will reset HEAD to another commit. It will also reset the index to match it while working directory will not be touched. 
		  All the changes will stay in the working directory and appear as modified, but not staged.
		  The main difference between --mixed and --soft is whether or not your index is also modified.
--hard  : This resets everything. It resets HEAD back to another commit, resets the index to match it, and resets the working directory to match it as well.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Example :
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
--soft :
- 69ffb8e (HEAD -> master) f1 added and committed
- 4997044 (HEAD -> master) f2 added and committed
  69ffb8e f1
- 0196392 (HEAD -> master) f3 added and committed
  4997044 f2
  69ffb8e f1
  
- git reset 69ffb8e
- git status		=> f2 f3 untracked files
- rm f2 f3
- git status		=> branch clean
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
--hard :
- 69ffb8e (HEAD -> master) f1 added and committed
- eddb618 (HEAD -> master) f2 added and committed
  69ffb8e f1
- 75226c7 (HEAD -> master) f3 added and committed
  eddb618 add f2
  69ffb8e f1

- git reset 69ffb8e --hard
- git status		=> branch clean
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- git reflog can recovering project history and it can recover almost anything even after "git reset xxxxxxxx --hard"

Fix the Previous Commit Message
Scenario: Everyone makes typo mistakes when writing commits and this is completely fine! It can be easily fixed before you do a git push.
Solution: Just run git commit --amend or git commit --amend -m 'The new message'. This will update and replace the most recent commit with a new commit.
- touch f1
- git add f1
- git commit -am "f1"
- git log --oneline					=> 69ffb8e (HEAD -> master) f1
- git commit --amend -m "added f1"
- git log --oneline					=> 2b2812f (HEAD -> master) added f1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          

* if we change any file (that already has been commited in git) in local repository, then we have to perform commit to that change, to update them in the index.
  git commit -a -m "comment"

* git pull = git fetch + git merge
  git pull  wil pull all changes from master branch and will apply to local repository.
  git fetch wil pull all changes from master branch and will store them in another chain, git merge is required again to apply the changes to local repository.

* Rebasing - Instead of doing similar commit which will have 2 parent commit, rebasing actually places the entire commit history of your branch on tip of master branch.
  Benifit - much cleaner project history, linear workflow and it reduces the number of branches.

Merge issue :
Installation mergetool :
* git mergetool --tool-help
* git mergetool --tool=vimdiff
-------------------------------
* git pull --rebase origin master 	-> 
* git mergetool --- make desired changes -> ":wq" to save and exit for all 3 files
* git rebase --continue

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          

New Ones : 
* git branch --merged - lists the branches that have been merged into the current branch
* git branch --no-merged branch_name - lists the branches that have not been merged into the current branch
* git branch -d[head] 
* git diff <commit-id1> <commit-id2> <file_list>
* git diff master b1 -- f1			#### difference in a file present in master and branch
* difference between ‘git remote’ and ‘git clone’ - ‘git remote add’ creates an entry in git config that specifies a name for a particular URL.  
						    ‘git clone’ creates a new git repository by copying and existing one located at the URI.


Q. How do you find a list of files that has changed in a particular commit?
A. For this answer instead of just telling the command, explain what exactly this command will do.
   To get a list files that has changed in a particular commit use the below command: git diff-tree -r hash_code

   Given the commit hash, this will list all the files that were changed or added in that commit. 
   The -r flag makes the command list individual files, rather than collapsing them into root directory names only. 
   You can also include the below mentioned point, although it is totally optional but will help in impressing the interviewer.
   The output will also include some extra information, which can be easily suppressed by including two flags:  git diff-tree –no-commit-id –name-only -r {hash}
   Here –no-commit-id will suppress the commit hashes from appearing in the output, and –name-only will only print the file names, instead of their paths.

Q. How do you squash last N commits into a single commit?
A. There are two options to squash last N commits into a single commit.
   - If you want to write the new commit message from scratch use the following command
     git reset –soft HEAD~N &&
     git commit
   - If you want to start editing the new commit message with a concatenation of the existing commit messages then you need to extract those messages and 
     pass them to Git commit for that I will use
     git reset –soft HEAD~N &&
     git commit –edit -m”$(git log –format=%B –reverse .HEAD@{N})”

Q. What is Git bisect? How can you use it to determine the source of a (regression) bug?
A. I will suggest you to first give a small definition of Git bisect.
   Git bisect is used to find the commit that introduced a bug by using binary search. Command for Git bisect is : git bisect <subcommand> <options>

   Now since you have mentioned the command above explain them what this command will do.

   This command uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit in your project’s history introduced a bug. 
   You use it by first telling it a “bad” commit that is known to contain the bug, and a “good” commit that is known to be before the bug was introduced. 
   Then Git bisect picks a commit between those two endpoints and asks you whether the selected commit is “good” or “bad”. 
   It continues narrowing down the range until it finds the exact commit that introduced the change.


git concepts :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          
* If we just create/add a file in anny branch without commiting and swiching to other branch,, the newly created file will appear there also.
  But, once we perform commit for that file in any one branch, the same file will go off from other branches.

* If we deleted any file by "git rm fileA" and did not perform commit and then switching to some other branch then, that delete command will have no impact at all.
  So, its important to delete and then confirm before switching to some other branch.
