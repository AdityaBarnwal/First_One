Installation of Ansnible :

We should signed in as test user before this operation..
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* To check which relese we are using in Linux, type "cat /etc/release" or "cat /etc/redhat-release"
  It gives o/p as "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.4 (Maipo) "

Before installing Ansible, we need to have EPEL (Extra Package repositoriy for Redhat 7) release installed on our master and node machine.
So, Redhat 7 acts as a package repositoy and we get all kind of package from EPEL.
To see if the repo is created or not, type "cd /etc/yum.repos.d/", if it shows 'redhat.repo', means it is created. 
(Command prompt will be "test@ip-172-31-18-171 yum.repos.d" after typing the above command)

But, we are going to create a more repo where we we get all kind of packages.

Steps for downloading EPEL repository :
---------------------------------------------
* Before creating repo, we need to install wget. To check if wget is installed or not, type "wget"
  If wget is not installed, we need to install it. For installing wget, type 'sudo yum install wget'
  It may take few seconds and may ask for confirmation, so, just type 'y'
  (If we configure EPEL, then by default we can get Ansible package)

Once, wget is installed, type "[test@ip-172-31-18-171 yum.repos.d]$ wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-7.noarch.rpm"
We may get permission denied because we are in 'etc' repos owned by root, so go to our home directory 'test' by typing 'cd ~test'
Command prompt will become "test@ip-172-31-18-171 ~" & type "wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-7.noarch.rpm"
							     wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-8.noarch.rpm
							     wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm - working
							     wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
							     sudo wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm ------ fianl working

Final working prm has been downloaded from http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL

* Once, it is done, type "ls -l" and it will show a rpm package "epel-release-7-7.noarch.rpm".
								"epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm." - working
								"epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm" ------ fianl working
  So, now we need to install this package by running command "rpm -ivh epel-release-7.7.noarch.rpm"
							     "rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm" - working
							     "rpm -ivh epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm" ------ fianl working
  For running this command we require sudo previliges, so we will type "sudo rpm -ivh epel-release-7-7.noarch.rpm"
								       "sudo rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm" - working
									sudo rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
								       "sudo rpm -ivh epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm" ------ fianl working
Now, come to yum.repos.d by typing "cd /etc/yum.repos.d/" and we can see a repo with name "epel repo"created which was not there previously.


Note: Download EPEL likewise in all machines.....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: We need to be in test@ip*******
Now, as we are done with the configuration with EPEL repositories, we need to update yum, before we try to install Ansible. For this, type "sudo yum update"
Do this in all machines. (It will update plugins)
It may notify the number of packages required for update and ask for confirmation, so type 'y'. So, they all will get updated.

So, once all yum files get installed/ Updated, we need to install Ansible.
Command to install Ansible is "sudo yum install ansible -y"
It will force install the Ansible and will check the dependencies. Once, we install ansible package, it will install the PYTHON dependibilities.
It proves that ansible uses python modules to install the packages.

To verify if ansible is installed, type "ansible --version" that shows ansible version (2.1.0.0) {2.5.0.0 in my case} and its config file (/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type 'pwd' and it should show : /etc/ansible
So, now as ansible is installed, we need to go inside most important file, anisble.cfg file by typing "more ansible.cfg" or "cat ansible.cfg"

In the file, we will see following important options :
#inventory         = /etc/ansible/hosts -- Here, we will be mentioning all our infrastructure nodes (node1, node2, etc) and we will group them in terms of categories.
#library 	   = /usr/share/my_modules/
#remote_temp 	   = $HOME/.ansible/tmp
#local_temp        = $HOME/.ansible/tmp
#forks 		   = 5			-- how much the ansible should fork if there is a no response from the client
#poll_interval     = 15			-- check evry 15 secs for i/p and o/p from client-master nodes
#sudo_user 	   = root		-- It will check if it needs root/ sudo previliges 
#ask_sudo_pass 	   = True		
#ask_pass 	   = True		
#transport 	   = smart		
#remote_port 	   = 22			
#module_lang 	   = C			
#module_set_locale = True		



* Always take a backup of this file using command "sudo cp ansible.cfg  ansible.cfg.original"

* "sudo vi ansible.cfg" and in "ansible.cfg" we need to change "#log_path = /var/log/ansible.log" to "log_path = /var/log/ansible.log"
  so that we can see what is happening in the back end and we can see the log parts.

* After changing the above, come out of that file and type "ansible --version" and now it will show something like :
  log file at /var/log/ansible.log is not writeable
  ansible 2.1.0.0
  congig file at etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

  So, make sure this log file is writeable. 
  Type "sudo chmod 777 /var/log" to make this directory available for writing. 
  Then, type "sudo chmod 777 /var/log/ansible.log" and then "ansible --version" and below lines appear :
  (As of now this log file will be empty as we have just installed anisble now)
  ansible 2.1.0.0
  config file (/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = Default w/o Overrides

* Now, as we know that ansible is dependent on python, we will check ansible-python dependencies. 
  In order to test the python which is involved in ansible, we will test if we have proper installed packages in al machines.
  So, we will type : [test@ip-172-31-2-156 ansible]$ sudo yum list installed|grep -i python  (---- which will give all python packages)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* So, now we need to test if python is able to run.
  Just type "python" and it will display the python version (2.7.5) (type quit () in order to quit). This python version should be same accross all machines.

  Create a python program and ru it from command "python program_name"
  Successful run of python program means that python is working fine on our machines (Do the same in all nodes)

* If pinging public IP is not wrking, then come to AWS account and under "Security Groups", check on your "Group Name".
  Click on "Actions" tab and then click on "Edit inbund rules".
  Select "All ICMP - IPv4" from "Type" column and then "Anywhere" from "Source" tab and save it.
  Now, we will be able to ping by using public or private IP.

* E45: 'readonly' option is set (add ! to override)
  press 'Esc' key , and then 'U' , and then type ':q' and then 'enter'
