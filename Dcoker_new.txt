* docker network rm -my-net 
* installing docker-compose :
  - sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.18.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  - chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  - docker-compose --version		#### docker-compose version 1.18.0, build 8dd22a9

* Docker Compose : examle 1
  Docker compose is used to run multi-container applications. 
  Each container will run a stand-alone application and it can communicate with other containers present in same host.
  Example : MEAN Stack Application (M - MongoDB, E - ExpressJS, A - Angular and N - NodeJS)
  
* Docker architecture examle :
  We need 3 docker containers to spun from their respective images to build MEAN application.
  Each of these 3 containers will be built from their respective docker files seperately and all 3 docker files will be called from a docker compose file.
  Docker file is written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language). Here, we mention following points :
  -> We specify the locations where our each of docker file is present.
  -> We specify the port number which a container needs to use to interact with ther container.
  -> If we have database, we may have to specify the link of the database, so that our servers and database can get connected.
					   ----> Docker File1 ----> Container1 for MongoDB database 						----> 
   Docker Compose File ----> Docker File2 ----> Container2 for ExpressJS and NodeJS for backend servers ----> MEAN
					   ----> Docker File3 ----> Container3 for Angular for front end client 			----> 

* docker-compose.yml :
----------------------
version: '3.0'				# specify docker-compose version
# Define the services/containers to be run
services:					# "services" is a key-word here
  angular: 					# name of the first service
    build: angular-app  	# specify the directory of the Dockerfile where our angular-app coding resides
	ports:
	  - "4200:4200" 		# specify port mapping, left "4200" is for host and right "4200" on docker where application will be running
	  
  express: 					# name of the second service
    build: express-server 	# specify the directory of the Dockerfile where our express-server coding resides
	ports:
	  - "3000:3000" 		# specify port mapping, left "3000" is for host and right "3000" on docker where application will be running
	links:
	  - database 			# link this service to the database service
	
  database: 				# name of the third service
    image: mongo 			# specify image to build container from
	ports:
	  - "27017:27017" 		# specify port forwarding, left "27017" is for host and right "27017" on docker where application will be running

* cd MEAN-Stack-App/
* ls 				# angular-app, docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yml~, express-server, npm-debug.log
* docker-compose up
* go to browser and type "localhost:4200" (front-end/ client) and the application would open
* go to browser and type "localhost:3000" (back-end/ server) and "foobar" will be displayed
* go to browser and type "localhost:27017" (database) and "It looks like you are .... driver port" will be displayed
* give inputs to "localhost:4200" (front-end/ client), then the input should be saved inside a database.
  So, to verify that, go to browser and type "localhost:3000/api/contacts" and it will show the data which we saved earlier.
