Declarative Pipelines Syntax :
==================================================================================================================
A valid Declarative pipeline must be defined with the "pipeline" sentence and include the next required sections:
01. Agent
02. Stages
03. Stage
04. Steps

Also, these are the available directives:
05. Environment (Defined at stage or pipeline level)
06. Input (Defined at stage level)
07. Options (Defined at stage or pipeline level)
08. Parallel
09. Parameters
10. Post
11. Script
12. Tools
13. Triggers
14. When
==================================================================================================================

01. Agent ( In the top-level pipeline block and each stage block ):
Jenkins provides the ability to perform distributed builds by delegating them to "agent" nodes. 
Doing this allows you to execute several projects with only one instance of the Jenkins server, while the workload is distributed to its agents. 
Details on how to configure a master/agent mode are out of the scope of this blog. Agents should be labeled, so they can be identified from each other. 
Nodes can be labeled by their platform (Linux, Windows, etc) by their versions or by their location, among others. 
The "agent" section configures on which nodes the pipeline can be run. 

Parameters of Agent :
---------------------
* agent any 				    - Jenkins will run the job on any of the available nodes.
  pipeline {
    agent any
    ...
  }
* agent { label '***' }   - Execute the Pipeline, or stage, on an agent available in the Jenkins environment with the provided label.
  pipeline {
    agent { label 'my-defined-label' }
    ...
  }
  
* agent none
When applied at the top-level of the pipeline block, no global agent will be allocated for the entire Pipeline run.
And each stage section will need to contain its own agent section.
pipeline {
    agent none 												---- 1
    stages {
        stage('Example Build') {
            agent { docker 'maven:3-alpine' } 				---- 2
            steps {
                echo 'Hello, Maven'
                sh 'mvn --version'
            }
        }
        stage('Example Test') {
            agent { docker 'openjdk:8-jre' } 				---- 3
            steps {
                echo 'Hello, JDK'
                sh 'java -version'
            }
        }
    }
}

1 - Defining agent none at the top-level of the Pipeline ensures that an Executor will not be assigned unnecessarily. 
    Using agent none also forces each stage section to contain its own agent section.
2 - Execute the steps in this stage in a newly created container using this image.
3 - Execute the steps in this stage in a newly created container using a different image from the previous stage

* agent { docker {...} }
Execute the Pipeline, with the given container which will be dynamically provisioned on a node pre-configured to accept Docker-based Pipelines,
or on a node matching the optionally defined label parameter. 
docker also optionally accepts an args parameter which may contain arguments to pass directly to a docker run invocation, and an alwaysPull option, 
which will force a docker pull even if the image name is already present. For example: agent { docker 'maven:3-alpine' } or
agent {
    docker {
        image 'maven:3-alpine'
        label 'my-defined-label'
        args  '-v /tmp:/tmp'
    }
}
  
* agent { dockerfile {...} }
Execute the Pipeline, or stage, with a container built from a Dockerfile contained in the source repository. 
In order to use this option, the Jenkinsfile must be loaded from either a Multibranch Pipeline, or a "Pipeline from SCM." 
Conventionally this is the Dockerfile in the root of the source repository: agent { dockerfile true }. 
If building a Dockerfile in another directory, use the dir option: agent { dockerfile { dir 'someSubDir' } }. 
If your Dockerfile has another name, you can specify the file name with the filename option. 
You can pass additional arguments to the docker build …​ command with the additionalBuildArgs option.
Like agent { dockerfile { additionalBuildArgs '--build-arg foo=bar' } }. 
For example, a repository with the file build/Dockerfile.build, expecting a build argument version:

agent {
    // Equivalent to "docker build -f Dockerfile.build --build-arg version=1.0.2 ./build/
    dockerfile {
        filename 'Dockerfile.build'
        dir 'build'
        label 'my-defined-label'
        additionalBuildArgs  '--build-arg version=1.0.2'
        args '-v /tmp:/tmp'
    }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
02. Stages :
This section allows generation of different stages on your pipeline that will be visualized as different segments when the job is run. 
At least one "stage" section must be defined on the "stages" section. Example of syntax :

pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    ...
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03. Stage :
At least one "stage" section must be defined on the "stages" section. It will contain the work that the pipeline will execute. 
Stages must be named accordingly, since Jenkins will display each of them on its interface.
Jenkins graphically splits pipeline execution based on the defined stages and displays their duration and whether it was successful or not. Example of syntax :

pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage ('build') {
      ...
    }
    stage ('test: integration-&-quality') {
	  ...
    }
    stage ('test: functional') {
      ...
    }
    stage ('deploy:prod') {
      ...
    }
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04. Steps :
Steps is defined into a "stage." At least one step must be defined in the "steps" section. For Linux and MacOS, shell is supported. Example of syntax :

steps {  
  sh 'echo "A one line step"'
  sh ''' 
  echo "A multiline step"'
  cd /tests/results
  ls -lrt
  '''
}

For Windows, bat or PowerShell can be used, example of syntax :

steps {  
  bat "mvn clean test -Dsuite=SMOKE_TEST -Denvironment=QA"
  powershell ".\funcional_tests.ps1"
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05. Environment (Defined at stage or pipeline level) :
This directive can be both defined at stage or pipeline level, which will determine the scope of its definitions. 
When "environment" is used at the "pipeline" level, its definitions will be valid for all of the pipeline steps. 
If instead it is defined within a "stage," it will only be valid for the particular stage. Example of syntax at the "pipeline" level:
Example of syntax at the "pipeline" level:

pipeline {
  agent any
  environment {
	OUTPUT_PATH = './outputs/'
  }
  stages {
	stage ('build') {
	  ...
	}
    ...
  }
}

Example of syntax at the "stage" level:
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
	stage ('build') {
	  environment {
		OUTPUT_PATH = './outputs/'
	  }
	  ...
	}
	...
  }
}
****************************************
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment { 															---- 1
        CC = 'clang'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            environment { 													---- 2
                AN_ACCESS_KEY = credentials('my-prefined-secret-text') 		---- 3
            }
            steps {
                sh 'printenv'
            }
        }
    }
}
}
1 - An environment directive used in the top-level pipeline block will apply to all steps within the Pipeline.
2 - An environment directive defined within a stage will only apply the given environment variables to steps within the stage.
3 - The environment block has a helper method credentials() defined which is used to access pre-defined Credentials by their identifier in the Jenkins environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06. Input (Defined at stage level) :
The "input" directive is defined at a stage level and provides the functionality to prompt for an input. The stage will be paused until a user manually confirms it.

The following configuration options can be used for this directive:

* message: This is a required option, where the message to be displayed to the user is specified.
* id: Optional identifier for the input. By default, the "stage" name is used.
* ok: Optional text for the Ok button.
* submitter: Optional list of users or external group names who are allowed to submit the input. By default, any user is allowed.
* submitterParameter: Optional name of an environment variable to set with the submitter name, if present.
* parameters: Optional list of parameters to be provided by the submitter.
Here is a sample pipeline containing this directive:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            input {
                message "Should we continue?"
                ok "Yes, we should."
                submitter "alice,bob"
                parameters {
                    string(name: 'PERSON', defaultValue: 'Mr Jenkins', description: 'Who should I say hello to?')
                }
            }
            steps {
                echo "Hello, ${PERSON}, nice to meet you."
            }
        }
    }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07. Options (Defined at stage or pipeline level) :
This directive will group the specific options for the whole pipeline. The available options are:
* buildDiscarder 
* disableConcurrentBuilds 
* overrideIndexTriggers 
* skipDefaultCheckout 
* skipStagesAfterUnstable 
* checkoutToSubdirectory 
* newContainerPerStage 
* timeout 
* retry 
* timestamps 
Please refer to https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#options for a full reference on this.

For example, you can configure your pipeline to be retried 3 times before failing by writing:

pipeline {
  agent any
  options {
	retry(3)
  }
  stages {
	...
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08. Parallel :
Jenkins pipeline Stages can have other stages nested inside that will be executed in parallel. 
This is done by adding the "parallel" directive to your script. An example of how to use it is provided:

stage('run-parallel-branches') {
  steps {
    parallel(
      a: {
		echo "Tests on Linux"
	  },
	  b: {
		echo "Tests on Windows"
	  }
	)
  }
}

Starting with Declarative Pipeline version 1.2, a new syntax was introduced, making the use of the parallel syntax much more declarative-like.
The previous script rewritten with this new syntax will look like:

pipeline {
  agent none
  stages {
    stage('Run Tests') {
	  parallel {
		stage('Test On Windows') {
		  agent {
			label "windows"
		  }
		  steps {
			bat "run-tests.bat"
		  }
		}
		stage('Test On Linux') {
		  agent {
			label "linux"
		  }
		  steps {
			sh "run-tests.sh"
		  }
		}
	  }
	}
  }
}

Any of the previous pipelines will look like this:
Start ----> Build -------> Run Tests -------> Deploy ----> End
					|    (Test On Linux)	   |
					|						   |
					---> (Test On Windows) ---> 
					
Both scripts will run the tests on different nodes since they run specific platform tests. 
Parallelism can also be used to simultaneously run stages on the same node by the use of multithreading, if your Jenkins server has enough CPU.

Some restrictions apply when using parallel stages:
* A stage directive can have either a parallel or steps directive but not both.
* A stage directive inside a parallel one cannot nest another parallel directive, only steps are allowed.
* Stage directives that have a parallel directive inside cannot have "agent" or "tools" directives defined.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09. Parameters :
This directive allows you to define a list of parameters to be used in the script. Parameters should be provided only once the pipeline is triggered. 
It should be defined at a "pipeline" level and only one Parameters directive is allowed for the whole pipeline.

String and boolean are the valid parameter types that can be used.

pipeline {
  agent any
  parameters {
	string(name: 'user', defaultValue: 'John', description: 'A user that triggers the pipeline')
  }
  stages {
	stage('Trigger pipeline') {
	  steps {
		echo "Pipeline triggered by ${params.USER}"
	  }
	}
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Post :
Post sections can be added at a pipeline level or on each stage block and sentences included in it are executed once the stage or pipeline completes. 
Several post-conditions can be used to control whether the post executes or not:

* always: Steps are executed regardless of the completion status.
* changed: Executes only if the completion results in a different status than the previous run.
* fixed: Executes only if the completion is successful and the previous run failed
* regression: Executes only if current execution fails, aborts or is unstable and the previous run was successful.
* aborted: Steps are executed only if the pipeline or stage is aborted.
* failure: Steps are executed only if the pipeline or stage fails.
* success: Steps are executed only if the pipeline or stage succeeds.
* unstable: Steps are executed only if the pipeline or stage is unstable.

Since sentences included in a pipeline post block will be run at the end of the script, cleanup tasks or notifications, among others, can be performed here.

pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
	stage('Some steps') {
	  steps {
		...
	  }
	}
  }
  post {
	always {
	  echo“ Pipeline finished”
	  bat. / performCleanUp.bat
	}
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Script : 
This step is used to add Scripted Pipeline sentences into a Declarative one, thus providing even more functionality. This step must be included at "stage" level.
Many times, blocks of scripts can be used on various projects. These blocks allows to extend Jenkins functionalities & can be implemented as shared libraries. 
More information on this can be found at https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/ 
Also, shared libraries can be imported and used into the "script" block, thus extending pipeline functionalities. Next we will provide sample pipelines. 
The first one will only have a block with a piece of Scripted pipeline text, while the second one will show how to import and use shared libraries:
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Sample') {
      steps {
        echo "Scripted block"
        script {
        }
      }
    }
   }
}

Please refer to our post about Scripted pipelines at below link for more information on this topic :
https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/how-to-use-the-jenkins-scripted-pipeline?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=BM_blog&utm_campaign=how-to-use-the-jenkins-declarative-pipeline 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Tools :
The "tools" directive can be added either at a pipeline level or at the stage level. 
It allows you to specify which maven, jdk, or gradle version to use on your script. 
Any of these tools, the three supported at the time of writing, must be configured on the "Global tool configuration" Jenkins menu.
Also, Jenkins will attempt to install the listed tool (if it is not installed yet). 
By using this directive you can make sure a specific version required for your project is installed.

pipeline {
  agent any
  tools {
	maven 'apache-maven-3.0.1'
  }
  stages {
	...
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Triggers :
Triggers allow Jenkins to automatically trigger pipelines by using any of the available ones:

* cron: By using cron syntax, it allows to define when the pipeline will be re-triggered.
* pollSCM: By using cron syntax, it allows you to define when Jenkins will check for new source repository updates. 
		   The Pipeline will be re-triggered if changes are detected. (Available starting with Jenkins 2.22).
* upstream: Takes as input a list of Jenkins jobs and a threshold. The pipeline will be triggered when any of the jobs on the list finish with the threshold condition.

Sample pipelines with the available triggers are shown next:
pipeline {
  agent any
  triggers {
    //Execute weekdays every four hours starting at minute 0
    cron('0 */4 * * 1-5')
  }
  stages {
	...
  }
}
pipeline {
  agent any
  triggers {
    //Query repository weekdays every four hours starting at minute 0
    pollSCM('0 */4 * * 1-5')
  }
  stages {
    ...
  }
}
pipeline {
  agent any
  triggers {
    //Execute when either job1 or job2 are successful
    upstream(upstreamProjects: 'job1, job2', threshold: hudson.model.Result.SUCCESS)
  }
  stages {
    ...
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. When :
Pipeline steps could be executed depending on the conditions defined in a "when" directive. 
If conditions match, the steps defined in the corresponding stage will be run. It should be defined at a stage level.

For a full list of the conditions and its explanations refer to https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#when directive.
For example, pipelines allow you to perform tasks on projects with more than one branch. 
This is known as multibranched pipelines, where specific actions can be taken depending on the branch name like "master", "feature*", "development", among others. 
Here is a sample pipeline that will run the steps for the master branch:

pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
	stage('Deploy stage') {
	  when {
		branch 'master'
	  }
	  steps {
		echo 'Deploy master to stage'
		...
	  }
	}
  }
}
