Jenkins installation :
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
First method : On Linux
++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Step-1 ::Install java
-----------------------
  yum install epel-release
  yum repolist
  yum list java* --show-duplicates
  yum install java							#### OR #### yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-src.x86_64 #### OR #### yum install openjdk-7-jdk
  java -version								#### openjdk version "1.8.0_171" 
  update-alternatives --config java			#### from listed options, select java with version "1.8"
  [If "java-version" doesn't work, we have to add it to path variables, like below :]
  echo $PATH								#### /usr/local/sbin/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin/:opt/puppetlabs/bin:/root/bin
   

Step-2 ::Install Maven
------------------------
* yum install maven2						#### It takes much time
  OR
* We can download the zip file as it will not take much time. 
  Go to "https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi" link and copy the link of "Binary zip archive" from "Files" paragraph
    - wget http://www-eu.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.5.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.zip
	  OR 
	  wget http://mirrors.wuchna.com/apachemirror/maven/maven-3/3.5.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.zip
	- ls								#### apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.zip OR #### apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.zip
	- yum install unzip
	- unzip apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.zip	#### apache-maven-3.3.9
	  OR
	  unzip apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.zip	#### apache-maven-3.5.4
	- rm apache-maven-3.3.9-bin.zip
	  OR
	  rm apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.zip
	- cd apache-maven-3.3.9/bin 
	  OR
	  cd apache-maven-3.5.4/bin 
	  
	  Two methods to set up maven :
	a> Setting Maven in jenkins, easy but only Jenkins and not system users will be able to use maven commands directly using "mvn".
	  - pwd					#### /root/apache-maven-3.3.9/bin -> copy this address, go to jenkins -> Configure System -> Maven -> Maven installation
							 [Name : Maven (anything)], [uncheck "Install automatically"], [Maven_HOME : /root/apache-maven-3.3.9/bin/] 
	  - chown -R jenkins:jenkins apache-maven-3.3.9 
	b> Adding 'path', so that everyone can use it.
	  - export PATH=$PATH:/root/apache-maven-3.3.9/bin/
	    OR
		export PATH='.........:/root/apache-maven-3.3.9/bin/'
	  - echo $PATH		#### /usr/local/sbin/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin/:opt/puppetlabs/bin:/root/bin:/root/apache-maven-3.3.9/bin/
	  
	- 'mvn' will work now in host.


Step-3 :: Install Jenkins
-------------------------
* yum list jenkins --show-duplicates		#### nothing should be displayed
* wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo	#### /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo' will not have any key.
  rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key    						#### ./jenkins.repo' will have key now, for purchased version.
OR
* wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
  rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
  


* yum list jenkins --show-duplicates		#### jenkins with some available versions (latest : 2.121.1) should be displayed
* yum install jenkins -y					#### jenkins gets installed at /var/lib/jenkins/
* systemctl status/start/enable jenkins
* chkconfig									#### tells if the application is supposed to start with the server or not (run level 5 should be "on")
* systemctl list-unit-files					#### tells, what are all services supposed to start with the server (like "services.msc" in windows)
* ip a										#### 192.168.191.151
* reboot									#### for rebooting the system, ONLY IF required
* vim /etc/sysconfig/jenkins				#### all jenkins configuration is listed here. Even ports of jenkins can be changed from here.
 
On CLI, message something like below appears :
ff3ed5247abd4905acb31f65fb39b916
This may also be found at: /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

* cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
* mv /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword  /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword.bak

Open a browser and type - 192.168.191.151:8080 and Jenkins page will appear.
The "Getting Started" page of Jenkins would ask for "Administrator password", give the above password there.
The page asking for "Customize Jenkins" appears with options "Install suggested plugins" and "Select plugins to install".
We will go with "Install suggested plugins" for now and it will install all required plugins.

Once, all plugins gets installed, click on "Continue" button and it opens "Create First Admin User" page asking for below inputs :
Username 		 :
Password 		 :
Confirm Password :
Full name 		 :
E-mail address   :

Either give the input for "First admin user" or click on "Continue as admin" and finally click on "Start using Jenkins" on "Jenkins is ready!" page.


Second method : On Windows
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Go to site "https://jenkins.io/downloads" and click on "Download" option.
* We would find various options of ".exe" under "LTS" (Long Term Support). Click on "Windows" and it will start getting downloaded.
So, once downloaded, we have to extract it. Click on ".exe" file and installation process starts. Once, it completes, port "localhost:8080" opens in browser.
Go to "services.msc" and check if jenkins has started or not. The Jenkins would have started now on browser with below message :

Please copy the password from : C:\Users\VmineV\.jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword


Third method : On Windows with ".war" files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Go to google and give "jenkins.war download for windows" and click on "jenkins.war" from "https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/war/"
* Various versions will be displayed, select any one among them and the ".war" files will get downloaded (2.121.1 - latest jenkins stable version)
* It will get downloaded with name "jenkins.war" of 71.8 MB in "Downloads" folder. 
  It is an artifact and can be used in 2 ways for installation of Jenkins.
  -> First way is (not recommended), as this is a .war file, we can directly deploy it using a JVM. So, we have to do the followings :
     - cd Downloads				#### Open the command prompt and move to the location where our ".war" file exists. 
	 - java -jar jenkins.war	#### this will start a JVM and will make jenkins started
	 - go to the browser and type "localhost:8080"
	 - The "Getting Started" page of Jenkins would ask for "Administrator password", which will be present in :
	   "C:\Users\VmineV\.jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword".
	   Go to that address and copy the password and paste it in "Administrator password".
  [DO NOT PRESS Ctrl + C, else the Jenkins will stop and all changes will get vanished...]
	 
  -> The second way is from Tomcat. So, we have to do the followings :
     - As the file is above 50 MB, copy-paste the jenkins.war file from "Downloads" into "C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat8.5\webapps"
	 - Open the browser and type "localhost:8089", the port where Tomcat has been configured.
	 - Click on "Manager App" and give "Username" and "Password". Since, "jenkins.war" is a .war file, we can directly deploy it.
	 - Click on "start" tab present for "/jenkins"
	   OR click on "Chose File" tab under "WAR file to deploy" and chose jenkins.war file and click on "Deploy"
	 -

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Another way of downloading all three (JAVA, Maven and Jenkins) - From Java Home Cloud :
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Jenkins Installation and Configuration :
---------------------------------------
* Go to "https://jenkins.io/download/" and under LTS click on "Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS".
  This version requires "Java 1.8", so we need to install Java 1.8.
* java -version							#### Java version "1.7.0_171", but we need Java 1.8
* yum list | grep java-1.8				#### Checking the available packages of java-1.8
* yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y
* java -version							#### Java version still pointing to "1.7", but we need Java 1.8
* update-alternatives --config java		#### from listed options, select java with version "1.8"
* java -version							#### Java version now pointing to "1.8".
* wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
* rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
* yum install jenkins -y
* service jenkins start					#### starting jenkins server on port 8080
* Go to browser, give IP_Address:8080	#### Jenkins page opens
* Copy the password from shown address	#### /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
* Click on "Continue" and "Install suggested plugins"
* After installations gets over for plugins, it asks to "Create First Admin User", give the details and click on "Save and Finish".
  DO NOT click on "Continue as admin", above admin user will not be created.
* Now, Jenkins is ready, we can click on "Start using Jenkins".
* chkconfig jenkins on 					#### start jenkins automatically, when the system is up/reboots every time.

Installation of Apache Maven and Git :
-----------------------------------------
Step 1 :
* cd /opt
* wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.5.3/binaries/apache-maven-3.5.3-bin.zip
* unzip apache-maven-3.5.3-bin.zip								#### apache-maven-3.5.3 will be present now.
* rm -rf apache-maven-3.5.3-bin.zip

Step 2 :
Maven command will be present inside "apache-maven-3.5.3/bin/mvn". We have to set a permanent path to this command.
* vi ~/.bashrc
  export M2_HOME=opt/apache-maven-3.5.3							#### needs to change as per our path (/opt/apache-maven-3.5.4)
  export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
  export PATH=$M2:$PATH
* source ~/.bashrc												#### reloading the source
* mvn --version 												#### shows 3.5.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OR, as per maven site :																														|
export M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.0.x		#### Add the M2_HOME environment variable from this command					|
export M2=$M2_HOME/bin											#### Add the M2 environment variable from this command						|
export PATH=$M2:$PATH											#### Add the M2 environment variable to your path from this command:		|
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3 :
* yum install git -y											#### installs git
	
Step 4 :
* Make sure that JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your JDK. For example: export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64
* Make sure that $JAVA_HOME/bin is in your PATH environment variable.
   Example : export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64
   
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Tomcat and Jenkins, both works on port "8080".
As we cannot work on two applications using same port, we need to change one's port. So, change the port of Tomcat.

Jenkins works on default port 8080. All jenkins configuration is listed in "cat /etc/sysconfig/jenkins". Even ports of jenkins can be changed from here.
